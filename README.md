## Movie App 

Develop a Web Application to get information of movies, Rated movies, latest movies and also information of particular movie like rating, trailer ,Description , Poster.<br/>
This application is developed using plain HTML , CSS ,JavaScript and Ajax.<br/>

The Application has a Search bar where you can search any movie (eg Conjuring ) . and it will fetch dynamic data and display the poster of movie on screen which are similar to our search. Then we can tap on the poster and see it’s detail , trailer and rating. <br/>
When you click on one of these movie poster, you display information about the movie: the poster of the movie as an image, the movie title, its genres (separated by comma), the movie overview (summary), <br/>
I have used the TMDB API to get the required data.<br/>
