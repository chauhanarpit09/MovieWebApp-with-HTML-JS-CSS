Develop a Web Application to get information of movies, Rated movies, latest movies and also information of particular movie like rating, trailer ,Description , Poster.
This application is developed using plain HTML , CSS ,JavaScript and Ajax.
The data is drawn asynchronously and the web page is never redrawn/refreshed completely. This means that the buttons or any other input element in your HTML forms have JavaScript actions, and not any regular HTTP requests.
The Application has a Search bar where you can search any movie (eg Conjuring ) . and it will fetch dynamic data and display the poster of movie on screen which are similar to our search. Then we can tap on the poster and see itâ€™s detail and trailer, rating. 
When you click on one of these movie titles, you display information about the movie: the poster of the movie as an image, the movie title, its genres (separated by comma), the movie overview (summary), 
I have used the TMDB API to get the required data.
