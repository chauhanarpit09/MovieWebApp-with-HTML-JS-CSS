## Movie App 

Develop a Web Application to get information of movies, Rated movies, latest movies and also information of particular movie like rating, trailer ,Description , Poster.<br/>
This application is developed using plain HTML , CSS ,JavaScript and Ajax.<br/>

The Application has a Search bar where you can search any movie (eg Conjuring ) . and it will fetch dynamic data and display the poster of movie on screen which are similar to our search. Then we can tap on the poster and see itâ€™s detail , trailer and rating. <br/>
When you click on one of these movie poster, you display information about the movie: the poster of the movie as an image, the movie title, its genres (separated by comma), the movie overview (summary), <br/>
I have used the TMDB API to get the required data.<br/>
